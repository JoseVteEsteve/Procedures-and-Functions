//An electronics store is offering a new advertising campaign for its customers, called "inches per money". 
//If a client wants to buy a new television and remove the old one, he can take it to this store and, depending on its size, 
//he will be able to benefit from a discount. 
//Create a function called DiscountCalc() that calculates the discount that the client is going to take for his new television 
//and the total price to pay for the new television knowing that: 
// - if the old television is 32 inches or less, the discount will be 2 euros per inch 
// - if the old television is 43 inches or less, the discount will be 3 euros per inch 
// - if the old television is more than 43 inches, the discount will be 5 euros per inch
